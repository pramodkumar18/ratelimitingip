Dear Aditi,

I am writing to tender my resignation from Egiz Solution, effective 03/05/2024. It is with a heavy heart that I make this decision, as I have immensely enjoyed my time at Egiz Solution and have great respect for the team and the work we do together.

Unfortunately, recent changes to the company's compensation structure, particularly the decision to downgrade salaries, have put me in a difficult position. After careful consideration, I have determined that it is in my best interest to seek new opportunities that align with my career goals and financial needs.

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities I've had at Egiz Solution. I have learned a great deal during my time here, and I am proud of the contributions I've made to the team. I sincerely appreciate the support and mentorship I've received from you and my colleagues.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my remaining time with the company. I am available to assist with training my replacement and completing any outstanding projects to the best of my ability.

Please let me know if there are any specific procedures I should follow as I prepare to depart. I am also open to discussing my resignation further if you believe there may be alternative solutions.

Thank you again for the opportunities and experiences I've had at Egiz Solution. I wish the company continued success in the future.

Sincerely,
Pramod Kumar
